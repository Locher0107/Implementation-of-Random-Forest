# Kaggle Smartphonr Competition (Python, R)
This is part of the code to implement machine learning models on smart phone data set. Our team has run diffent models based on different language and tools. So this python code is just part of our coding work. For example, sometimes we need to clean data set and build some models like on R, which is more convenient. Sometimes Matlab is a more efficient tools and can be submitted to large-scale cluster.

In this work, we basically run 18-fold cross validation on the data set based many base-learners, such as SVM, Randomforest, Xgboost and LDA ect. At last we combine them together to an ensemble model by using Xgboost or Logistics regression.
